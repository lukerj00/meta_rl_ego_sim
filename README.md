# A Meta-RL Framework for Investigating Sensorimotor Transform in the Superior Colliculus

## Project Overview

This repository contains source code, documentation, and results for my master's project (title), which considers superior colliculus-inspired meta RL simulations in continuous and discrete action spaces.

The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that plays a crucial role in sensorimotor integration and orienting behavior. This project aims to develop computational models of the SC using meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms to gain insights into its functioning and underlying mechanisms.
